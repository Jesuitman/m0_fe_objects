# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I feel very good about having done all of this, there were definitely challenges along the way, I know istruggled with the for statements but review has been helping me as well as doing every practice question on the lessons

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

My workflow is good! I feel very engrossed by this, especially when its going well. when it isnt going well i just take a walk and play with my dog and that helps me recenter

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

Literally all of it. I have all of my notes and all of my projects stored so I wont lsot anything, even if i forget
